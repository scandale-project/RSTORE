# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Last stable version always provides security updates.
There will be no security patches for other releases (tagged or not).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the case of a security vulnerability report, we ask the reporter
to send it directly to [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/contact/), if
possible encrypted with the following GnuPG key:
**CA57 2205 C002 4E06 BA70 BE89 EAAD CFFC 22BD 4CD5**.
We usually fix reported and confirmed security vulnerabilities
in less than 48 hours, followed by a software release containing
the fixes within the following days.
